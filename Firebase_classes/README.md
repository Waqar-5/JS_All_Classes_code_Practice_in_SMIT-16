## Firebase Security
- Firebase keys in frontend are **safe** and used as identifiers only.  
- All projects implement **authentication rules** to protect user data.  
- Optionally, Firebase App Check can be enabled to prevent unauthorized access.  

**Note:** Service account credentials or sensitive backend keys are never exposed in the frontend.
