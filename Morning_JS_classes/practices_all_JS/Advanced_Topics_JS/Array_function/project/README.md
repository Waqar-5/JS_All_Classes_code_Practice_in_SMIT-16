## Overview
This is a **single-file, interactive HTML app** that demonstrates:  
- Basic arrow functions  
- Arrow functions with multiple statements  
- Array operations using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`  
- Lexical `this` in objects and callbacks  
- Nested and curried arrow functions  
- Rest parameters  

The app allows you to **input data and see live results**, making it perfect for **practical learning** and **interview preparation**.

## Features
✅ **Interactive Calculator** – Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using arrow functions.  
✅ **Array Playground** – Experiment with arrays and apply map, filter, and reduce in real-time.  
✅ **Lexical `this` Explorer** – Understand how arrow functions bind `this` lexically inside objects.  
✅ **Nested Arrow Functions (Currying)** – Practice advanced concepts of nested arrow functions.  
✅ **Rest Parameters Demo** – Sum multiple numbers using rest parameters.  
✅ **Live Output & Explanations** – See results instantly along with comments explaining the logic.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Interact with the different sections:  
   - **Calculator:** Input numbers and choose operations.  
   - **Array Playground:** Enter numbers separated by commas and click "Run Array Operations".  
   - **Lexical `this` Explorer:** Click the button to see team members with lexical `this`.  
   - **Nested Arrow Functions:** Input numbers to see curried multiplication in action.  
   - **Rest Parameters:** Enter numbers separated by commas to calculate their sum.  
4. Observe the live output and read the explanations.

## Arrow Function Concepts Covered
1. **Basic Syntax** – `(params) => expression`  
2. **Implicit & Explicit Return** – Single-line vs multiple statements  
3. **Lexical `this`** – How arrow functions inherit `this` from the surrounding scope  
4. **Array Methods** – `map`, `filter`, `reduce` using arrow functions  
5. **Nested & Curried Functions** – Using arrow functions for higher-order programming  
6. **Rest Parameters** – Handling variable number of arguments
