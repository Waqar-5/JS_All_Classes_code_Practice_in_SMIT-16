📚 Key Concepts You’ll Learn

DOM Selection: document.getElementById()

Replacing Classes: element.className = "hidden"

Adding Classes: element.className += " big" (with space!)

Modern Approach:

element.classList.add("big")

element.classList.remove("hidden")

element.classList.toggle("hidden")

Event Handling: onclick, hover effects.

CSS Tricks: display: none, font styling, transitions.

Demonstrates both old (className) and modern (classList) methods.

Interactive → you’ll see and feel the difference.

Great base for menus, popups, galleries, games.
