✨ Interactive Profile Page

This project is designed to give you a perfect hands-on experience with JavaScript DOM manipulation. It brings together three important concepts into one fun and interactive project:

Swapping images (using the src property)

Getting the address of a link (using the href property)

Changing the look of a form (using the className property)

🎯 Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to show how JavaScript can:

Find elements in a web page by their ID

Read or change properties of those elements

Make pages interactive and dynamic by responding to user actions like clicks

📂 Project Structure

The project is split into three separate files:

HTML file → Provides the structure (headings, image, link, form, and buttons).

CSS file → Adds the design (colors, styles, hover effects, and a special “jumbo” form style).

JavaScript file → Adds the behavior (swapping images, getting a link’s address, enlarging the form).

Keeping them separate makes the project organized and professional, and it matches how real-world web development is done.

🚀 How It Works

Image Swap

The page starts with a default profile picture.

When you click the image, JavaScript changes its src property to display another picture.

This demonstrates how we can replace images dynamically.

Get Link Address

A link is displayed (e.g., “Go to Wikipedia”).

When you click the button, JavaScript fetches the link’s href property and shows it in an alert box.

This demonstrates how to read information from elements.

Change Form Style

A simple contact form is displayed.

When you click the “Enlarge Form” button, JavaScript changes the form’s className to “jumbo.”

The CSS file has a style rule for the “jumbo” class, so the form becomes bigger and styled differently.

This demonstrates how to switch styles instantly by changing classes.

🎨 Features

Interactive Image → Clicking the picture replaces it with another.

Link Explorer → You can find out the exact web address of the link by pressing a button.

Dynamic Form Styling → One button click transforms the form’s appearance using CSS.

Clean Design → Gradient background, hover effects, and rounded corners make it modern and user-friendly.

Separation of Concerns → HTML, CSS, and JS are in different files for better understanding.

✅ Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

Understand how to access elements by ID using JavaScript.

Learn to change properties like src, href, and className.

See how CSS classes can completely change the style of an element with one line of JavaScript.

Experience how HTML, CSS, and JS connect together in a real project.

Gain confidence to make your own interactive web pages.

📸 How to Try It

Prepare two images → one for “before” and one for “after.”

Open the HTML file in your browser.

Try these actions:

Click the image → it swaps.

Click “Show Link Address” → it shows the website in an alert.

Click “Enlarge Form” → the form gets bigger and styled differently.

🌟 Why This Project is Unique

It combines all the main DOM property manipulations you learned (src, href, className).

It shows both reading properties (like getting a link’s address) and writing properties (like swapping an image or applying a class).

It is designed to be fun, simple, and practical, giving you real-world confidence.

It creates a beautiful interactive page instead of just plain examples.
