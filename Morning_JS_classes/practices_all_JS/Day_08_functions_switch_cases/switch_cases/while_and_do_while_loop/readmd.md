ðŸŽ¯ Animated Number Guessing Game
Overview

The Animated Number Guessing Game is an interactive and visually engaging web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It challenges players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 50 within a limited number of attempts. The game provides real-time feedback, dynamic background changes, and exciting confetti animations upon success, creating a fun and immersive experience.

This project is perfect for beginners to intermediate developers who want to learn about DOM manipulation, event handling, loops, conditional logic, and canvas animations in JavaScript.

Features

Random Number Generation: Each game generates a new random number between 1 and 50.

Limited Attempts: Players have 5 attempts to guess the number correctly.

Dynamic Feedback:

"Too low! Try higher"

"Too high! Try lower"

"Congratulations! You guessed it right!"

Animated Backgrounds: Background gradient changes dynamically based on guess outcome:

Green for correct guess

Pink/Orange for high/low guesses

Red for game over

Confetti Celebration: A vibrant confetti animation is triggered when the player wins.

Play Again: Option to restart the game instantly after winning or losing.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

User-Friendly Interface: Smooth input animations, hover effects on buttons, and interactive messages enhance user experience.

Technologies Used

HTML5: Structure and input elements

CSS3: Styling, gradients, animations, and responsive layout

JavaScript (ES6+): Game logic, event handling, DOM manipulation, and canvas-based confetti animation
