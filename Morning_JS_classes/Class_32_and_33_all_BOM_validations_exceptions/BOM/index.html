    <h1>Welcome in learning BOM in JS.</h1>
    <p>BOM stands for Bill of Materials, which is a detailed list of all the raw materials, parts, components, and quantities needed to manufacture a product. It functions like a recipe for production, providing the necessary "ingredients" and specifications to build a finished or sub-assembly item effectively.  
        Purpose: A BOM is crucial in manufacturing for production planning, inventory management, cost estimation, and process optimization. 
        Contents: It lists all components, their specifications, and the required quantities. For example, a smartphone's BOM would list the display, battery, memory, cameras, processor, and other parts with their specific quantities. 
        Function: It acts as a blueprint for production, ensuring the right parts are used in the correct amounts to create a consistent, quality product. 
        Types: There are different types of BOMs, such as engineering and manufacturing BOMs, which serve specific purposes in the product development and production lifecycle</p>
